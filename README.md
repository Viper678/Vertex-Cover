# Parameterized Algorithms and Experiments

## Overview

This project explores parameterized algorithms and their practical applications, focusing on two classical NP-hard problems:

1. Vertex Cover
2. Feedback Vertex Set (FVS)

The goal is to study the effectiveness of kernelization procedures on standard benchmark instances and evaluate their performance as precursors to parameterized algorithms.

## Key Concepts

- **Parameterized Complexity**: An approach to tackle NP-hard problems by designing algorithms whose exponential factor in running time is restricted to a parameter associated with the input.
- **Kernelization**: A polynomial-time algorithm that transforms an arbitrary instance of a problem into an equivalent instance of the same problem, with size bounded by a function of the original instance's parameter.

## Algorithms Explored

### Vertex Cover
- Naive Approach
- Branching Algorithm
- 2-Approximation Algorithm
- C(n,k) Algorithm
- LP-based Kernel

### Feedback Vertex Set (FVS)
- Branching Algorithm with reduction rules

## Future Work

- Implement the listed algorithms
- Run algorithms on standard benchmark instances
- Document results
- Apply kernelization and compare performance
- Analyze the effects of kernelization on runtime

## Goal

This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical analysis of parameterized algorithms and algorithm engineering, potentially inspiring new theoretical developments for practical purposes.
